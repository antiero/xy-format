# 2026-06-13 — Bar menu inspection

Fixture pack: `src/bar-menu-probes/2026-06-bar-menu/`

Firmware 1.1.4 probe pack targeting checklist §4 bar-menu gaps for Scene 1,
Track 1, Pattern 1.

## Decoded fields

| Field | Track offset | Encoding | Fixtures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default step length | `+0x02` | u16 LE ticks; baseline `240` (UI 50), min capture `4`, max `480`; one detent near center = 4 ticks | `bar-l-*` |
| Quantization | `+0x07` | raw byte; baseline/UI 100 `0xFF`, UI 0 `0x00`, UI 1/2 `0x04`/`0x07`, UI 98/99 `0xFC`/`0xFE`; middle scaling still needs more points | `bar-q-*` |
| Per-track groove override | `+0x08` | raw signed index byte: storage is `3 * index` into the hand-written UI sequence; index +1 = UI +2, +2 = +4, +3 = +7, etc. | `bar-g*` |
| P-lock interpolation/shape | `+0x3056` | raw byte; default/min `0x00`, min+1/+2 `0x04`/`0x08`, max-side `0xF7`/`0xFB`/`0xFF` | `bar-s-*` |

Most quantization, length, and groove edits also clear the T1 pristine flag at
`+0x11` (`08 00 -> 00 00`). Shape edits do not in this pack.

## Notes

The old `bar-q-max.xy` was renamed to `bar-l-051.xy`: quantization is already
max/default in `bar0`, and that capture changes length to `244` ticks while
leaving quantization `0xFF`.

`bar-gp002.xy` is suspicious: it stores `0x09`, same as `bar-gp007.xy`, while
`bar-gp004.xy` stores `0x06`. Under the index model this decodes as UI +7, not
UI +2. Treat that one low-positive capture as needing recapture.

These fields overlap the old track-signature bytes used by the historical
scanner. `xy/bar_menu_inspection.py` reads the baseline-shape BAR pack by
canonical decoded-image base/stride instead of signature scanning.
